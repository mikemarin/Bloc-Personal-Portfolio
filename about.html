            Hi! You’ve stumbled into the section where I share a bit about myself, personally.<br />
            I feel it’s important to speak about who I am, where I’m from and where I see myself going.

            My first real inspiration for becoming a designer came when I was working at a local sign shop. We had a client that could come print these wonderfully designed banners and signs for his church. Each design would evoke such strong feelings of warmth, togetherness and faith in me and unconsciously made me want to be a part of this community. All the elements worked together to create such a strong feeling and I wanted to learn how I could create and harness those emotions in my work. I was inspired. Shortly after, I began my formal education in graphic and web design and the rest is history.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nowadays, I have found my happy place working as a Visual Design in UX and I’ve learned even more about how design can bring out a wide range of emotions. I’ve gained skills in graphic design, web design, and did a small stint with motion design. Building on my skills as a UX Designer has allowed me to utilize data research, strategy, user needs and empathy to help direct my design methods. As a techie at heart I’m excited to see advancing technologies and how they can be utilized to help shape my next project.
