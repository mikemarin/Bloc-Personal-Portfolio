          </div>

          <p class="paragraph-02 sans-serif">
            As a society, we've evolved from hunting and gathering food on our own to ordering food through the drive thru at our local eatery. The old time tradition of preparing and eating healthy food has been mostly put aside for the sake of convenience. But at what cost?
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-02 p-02-last sans-serif">
            What Foodle sets out to achieve is to present its users with the ability to plan what they'd like to eat ahead of time for the week, month, etc. Users will be able to search and select recipes from a database born of collaboration with online sources as well as personal contributions from other users. They will also have the ability to rate their favorite recipes, photograph their food creations, and post those creations for their followers and community to view.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Ideas Without a Direction</h3>
          </div>

          <p class="paragraph-02 sans-serif">
            Our client had the idea of creating a new application that would be able to fit in under the broad umbrella of online content storage and organization with a focus on content creation, organization and collaboration. The app needed to be able to leverage the “network effect” to ensure positive growth so collaboration was a big focus. With this in mind I knew that a social sharing application could have a strong foundation to build on. With this as my starting point, I started thinking about what people of all types might have in common.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-02 p-02-last sans-serif">
            After researching different ideas I came to the conclusion that food would be an interesting and uniting focal point for this application. It is widely popular with all types of demographics and people love to post and share what they eat when they are eating it. What better way to bring people together than with their obsession with food.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <h3>Finding a Niche Market</h3>
          </div>

          <p class="paragraph-02 sans-serif">
            The solution I proposed was to explore the idea of food as a unifying concept that could incorporate sharing, content creation and collaboration. These were the biggest deliverables our client requested and following this approach allowed for more creative exploration in a niche area not over-saturated by a multitude of similar applications.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-02 sans-serif">
            The problem as I saw it was I needed to “Establish an app direction that refined the clients requirements into a deliverable that can stand out in a saturated market.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-02 sans-serif">
            After reviewing this list again, I saw this as sort of a recipe with each of the requirements as ingredients, with one part organization, a dash or collaboration, a sprinkle of online posting, and the main ingredient. FOOD!
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-02 p-02-last sans-serif">
            That’s how the idea of Foodle was born.

              The initial direction was for the app to follow the lines of a file sharing & storage application.

            With the user flows finished, my thinking started on how to start thinking about content and actions on a more granular level. Aside from the screens, I had to determine what actions I wanted to have on each screen and drawing up an outline really helped with consolidating what would go where. Doing some work on color schemes and imagery gave me a good idea on where I wanted to take the app design in later stages. Even though the app's design changed from initial conception, this was an important step to take as I was able to reference what I did here to see what worked and what I needed to improve on.

            Using the information provided by the sitemap, I started to work out how I wanted information to be shown on each screen of the app. On paper I drew what I believed would be a rough representation of the screens that I would show in each feature. At the stage, I wasn’t worried about content or detail and just put the thoughts to paper. Creating wireframes this way helped me work out different layout ideas from screen to screen, as well as assisted in broader thinking of other screens that I hadn't accounted for in my sitemap such as confirmation and error screens.

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph-02">
          For my first round of testing I chose testers that represented the demographics that my personas were built on and let them have a go at the prototype. These initial tests were done with two in a personal setting and one remotely. While I worked well with the two that were done in the same room, the one done remotely was a bit challenging since I wasn’t able to read the body language of test subject like the other two.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-02">
          Working with the test subjects in person, I was able to listen to them as they worked through the scenarios that I provided them. They all had familiar working with mobile apps before and we didn’t have a moment where they were stumped, however they did provide some valuable insight on what I could improve upon in later testing, since this was only showing plain wireframes.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-02">
          One thing I learned in these tests was how privacy was a concern amongst these users. I learned that users wanted to try out the app prior to providing their personal info, just in case they didn't want to commit fully to the app. Adding another place to sign in after bypassing the welcome / login screens was what I thinking to solve this problem.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-02">
          Adding confirmation screens and user feedback screens were also requested as when users where interacting with the wireframe prototype, they were expecting more details to be shown on screen other than the basics of each screen.

          In thinking about the visual approach to this app, I first had to establish a name for it. The idea came through using both a mind mapping and list making exercise where I wrote down everything I could regarding my thoughts and feelings towards this idea. With tossing around different names, I came up with the unusual but fun name of Foodle.

          Sketches were created to stylize the name into a logo that I felt represented what I had in mind for the brand. The moodboards served as a place where I placed visuals and design elements that I wanted to retain and draw inspiration from in later designs.

          Reviewing other references along with the moodboard choices put me in a good position to start working on a draft of Foodle’s style guide. This allowed me to further narrow down specific imagery, colors, and typography usages to assist with future styling needs. This formal style guide was meant to aid future developers and marketers on how to utilize the Foodle brand.

        <p class="paragraph-02 p-02-last">
          After establishing a concise direction for the art style of the MVP, there were a few times where I went back and forth about including a specific style of an element. Adding Preference Testing to this project allowed for testers to remark whether they liked one different style or another. I found this quite useful as I was looking for more immediate snap reactions other than long drawn out reasons why they liked one or another. Testing was done via link provided through Slack and other messaging apps, and subjects were friends and other peers from Bloc. While the test was active, I had a total of 20 participants that gave their opinions.

            <p class="paragraph-04">
              Since Foodle was meant to provide users to photograph their content to share with other users, I wanted to have a dedicated camera button for users to easily tap to access this feature. My first attempt to address this was to have it as an icon on the Tab Bar with its name below. While it conveyed the message, another approach I wanted to go with was having a circular button in the center of the bar. This was similar to the shutter button on iOS and I believed users would relate to this one more. I was correct in that assumption, however, what I found was the protruding arch at the top of the button was covering content, and I found that problematic when scrolling through content. I took the idea of B and confined it to the height of the Tab Bar. The final solution looked much cleaner and still was easy to understand.

              I wanted to give users the option to delete their selected meal plans and chose to present this with a persistent button on each item. No swiping actions or hidden gestures, just tap to delete the item. I wanted to see how this would translate without the color background and just adding the icon along with a dark gradient. The users tested found option A to be more visually appealing than B.

              For this test I was looking for feedback on a style of button that persisted on the screen as the user scrolled through the content. I had used the pattern shown in option A before on the recipe screen, and thought it would work well on the recipe card screen as well. I also thought of using a floating button that had the same persistent on screen behavior. My initial feeling on B was that it was too similar a design to the 'meal plan' button at the top of the card. Testers felt the same and agreed option A would be the winner.

          With the second round of testing, I went a different approach and did these tests all remotely. I received some valuable feedback that allowed my prototypes to be more expressive in the future, along with the benefit for getting better feedback as well. However, using this method caused my time spent working with my prototype to balloon more than expected. Instead of testing linear user flows like before, I prototyped all the screens together in a comprehensive prototype. While time consuming to put together, I learned this method would allow complete immersion of the user in the app, and other than a fully functional HTML prototype, this was the next best thing.

        <p class="paragraph-02 p-02-last">
          In this prototype, I categorized two sets of screens between the user signing in or not.. This took the testers to different screens and even though the testing was done over cellular, they were impressed with the level of thought and detail that was put into the prototypes. The feedback given by the users was more visual than interaction based, and I made sure that most of it was implemented it in the final version of Foodle's MVP.

              I think the idea to solve the client requirements was done fairly adequately. I purposely didn’t want to go to another Dropbox clone, and I believe the attempt to take the idea I came up with and work it to meet the client feature requirement worked out fairly well. I’m happy with the feedback that I’ve received from testers regarding the visuals of this project, and glad they add to the final polished look of the MVP. The idea of this app was fairly solid and I received a good bit of feedback on how it could be used by people in the future if it was expanded upon and created.

              I think in the current technological era there are so many things grabbing for your attention, people take for granted on how those things actually came into existence. Not many people find it fascinating to see the early steps of how something came to be, they just want to see the finished product. Feedback is important and necessary to keep a project progressing, and if the feedback is more towards the end result instead of the step that you’re at, the progression stagnates a bit. Asking questions and following up is a key factor I learned to help keep pushing progress forward.

              The level of detail that I went through going into the usability testing. Not only did I have to coordinate with others, but I provided a great amount of detail about each encounter. Since this has been done before, I did the same amount of note taking as done previously, but it’s hard to see how a good majority of it was beneficial as it wasn’t leveraged in the revisions. Maybe with more testing in the future, my approach will become more concise instead of
              trying to distill the whole scene onto paper.
